# Proximity light

A [`ProximityLight`](xref:Microsoft.MixedReality.Toolkit.Utilities.ProximityLight) is a [Fluent Design System](https://www.microsoft.com/design/fluent/) paradigm that mimics a "gradient inverse point light" hovering near the surface of an object. Often used for near interactions, the application can control the properties of a Proximity Light via the [`ProximityLight`](xref:Microsoft.MixedReality.Toolkit.Utilities.ProximityLight) component.

For a material to be influenced by a [`ProximityLight`](xref:Microsoft.MixedReality.Toolkit.Utilities.ProximityLight) the *Mixed Reality Toolkit/Standard* shader must be used and the *Proximity Light* property must be enabled.

> [!NOTE]
> Up to two [`ProximityLights`](xref:Microsoft.MixedReality.Toolkit.Utilities.ProximityLight) are supported by default.

## Examples

Most scenes within the MRTK utilize a [`ProximityLight`](xref:Microsoft.MixedReality.Toolkit.Utilities.ProximityLight). The most common use case can be found on the MRTK/SDK/Features/UX/Prefabs/Cursors/FingerCursor.prefab

## Advanced Usage

By default only two [`ProximityLights`](xref:Microsoft.MixedReality.Toolkit.Utilities.ProximityLight) can illuminate a [material](https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/Material.html) at a time. If your project requires more than two [`ProximityLights`](xref:Microsoft.MixedReality.Toolkit.Utilities.ProximityLight) to influence a [material](https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/Material.html) the sample code below demonstrates how to achieve this.

> [!NOTE]
> Having many [`ProximityLights`](xref:Microsoft.MixedReality.Toolkit.Utilities.ProximityLight) illuminate a [material](https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/Material.html) will increase pixel shader instructions and will impact performance. Please profile these changes within your project.

*How to increase the number of available [`ProximityLights`](xref:Microsoft.MixedReality.Toolkit.Utilities.ProximityLight)
 from two to four.*

```C#
// 1) Within MRTK/Core/StandardAssets/Shaders/MixedRealityStandard.shader change:

#define PROXIMITY_LIGHT_COUNT 2

// to:

#define PROXIMITY_LIGHT_COUNT 4

// 2) Within MRTK/Core/Utilities/StandardShader/ProximityLight.cs change:

private const int proximityLightCount = 2;

// to:

private const int proximityLightCount = 4;
```

> [!NOTE]
> If Unity logs a warning similar to below then you must restart Unity before your changes will take effect.
>
>`Property (_ProximityLightData) exceeds previous array size (24 vs 12). Cap to previous size.`
