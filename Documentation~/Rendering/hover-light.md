# Hover light

A [`HoverLight`](xref:Microsoft.MixedReality.Toolkit.Utilities.HoverLight) is a [Fluent Design System](https://www.microsoft.com/design/fluent/) paradigm that mimics a [point light](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/Lighting.html) hovering near the surface of an object. Often used for far away interactions, the application can control the properties of a Hover Light via the [`HoverLight`](xref:Microsoft.MixedReality.Toolkit.Utilities.HoverLight) component.

For a material to be influenced by a [`HoverLight`](xref:Microsoft.MixedReality.Toolkit.Utilities.HoverLight) the *Mixed Reality Toolkit/Standard* shader must be used and the *Hover Light* property must be enabled.

> [!Note]
> The MRTK/Standard shader supports up to two [`HoverLights`](xref:Microsoft.MixedReality.Toolkit.Utilities.HoverLight) by default, but will scale to support four and then ten as more lights are added to the scene.

## Examples

Most scenes within the MRTK utilize a [`HoverLight`](xref:Microsoft.MixedReality.Toolkit.Utilities.HoverLight). The most common use case can be found on the MRTK/SDK/Features/UX/Prefabs/Cursors/DefaultCursor.prefab

The **HoverLightExamples** scene also demonstrates usage of [`HoverLight`](xref:Microsoft.MixedReality.Toolkit.Utilities.HoverLight) behaviors, and can be found at: MRTK/Examples/Demos/StandardShader/Scenes/

## Advanced Usage

Only ten [`HoverLights`](xref:Microsoft.MixedReality.Toolkit.Utilities.HoverLight) can illuminate a [material](https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/Material.html) at a time. If your project requires more than ten [`HoverLights`](xref:Microsoft.MixedReality.Toolkit.Utilities.HoverLight) to influence a [material](https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/Material.html) the sample code below demonstrates how to achieve this.

> [!Note]
> Having many [`HoverLights`](xref:Microsoft.MixedReality.Toolkit.Utilities.HoverLight) illuminate a [material](https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/Material.html) will increase pixel shader instructions and will impact performance. **Please profile these changes within your project.**

*How to increase the number of available [`HoverLights`](xref:Microsoft.MixedReality.Toolkit.Utilities.HoverLight)
 from ten to twelve.*

```C#
// 1) Within MRTK/Core/StandardAssets/Shaders/MixedRealityStandard.shader change:

#if defined(_HOVER_LIGHT_HIGH)
#define HOVER_LIGHT_COUNT 10

// to:

#if defined(_HOVER_LIGHT_HIGH)
#define HOVER_LIGHT_COUNT 12

// 2) Within MRTK/Core/Utilities/StandardShader/HoverLight.cs change:

private const int hoverLightCountHigh = 10;

// to:

private const int hoverLightCountHigh = 12;
```

> [!NOTE]
> If Unity logs a warning similar to below then you must restart Unity before your changes will take effect.
>
> `Property (_HoverLightData) exceeds previous array size (24 vs 20). Cap to previous >size.`
